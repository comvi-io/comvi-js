# @comvi/vite-plugin

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e5370c: **BREAKING: these packages are now ESM-only.**

  v0.3 targets the modern bundler-resolution toolchain. The CJS build (`require()` entry / `main` / `.cjs`) and the dual `.d.cts` type declarations are no longer published — each package ships a single ESM bundle plus one `.d.ts` per entry. Import via ESM or any modern bundler (Vite, webpack 5, esbuild, Rollup, Rspack, Next, etc.).
  - **Migration:** replace `const x = require("@comvi/…")` with `import x from "@comvi/…"`, or consume through a bundler. There is no `require()`/CJS entry point.
  - The CDN UMD/IIFE builds are unaffected: `@comvi/core` still ships `comvi-core.global.prod.js` (`unpkg`/`jsdelivr`), and `@comvi/plugin-in-context-editor` still ships `standalone.iife.js` (`./standalone`).
  - This removes the `emit-d-cts.mjs` post-build stopgap and all dual-format machinery; declarations are produced directly by the build (`vite-plugin-dts`) and resolve cleanly under bundler resolution.
  - `@comvi/solid` declarations are now correctly populated (`tsconfig` `rootDir`/`outDir` restored — previously the advertised `dist/index.d.ts` was an empty `export {}` stub).
  - Package metadata: `repository.url` carries the required `git+` prefix.

- c423773: Change the default local translation file layout for v0.3. The namespace marked as default in the TMS now maps to root locale files such as `en.json`, while other namespaces map to `{namespace}/{languageTag}.json` such as `admin/en.json`.

  `comvi pull`, `comvi push`, and CLI type generation now resolve the default namespace from the backend instead of treating `.comvirc.json` as the source of truth. Custom `fileTemplate` values remain literal; set `"fileTemplate": "{languageTag}/{namespace}.json"` to keep the v0.2 layout.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Coordinated `0.2.0` release across all `@comvi/*` packages. The CLI ships its first set of meaningful new features (`.env` auto-load, `namespaces` / `locales` config filters, terminology cleanup); the framework bindings, plugins, and core bump in lockstep so every package on a given install moves to the same baseline version.

### Patch Changes

- cba88bf: Fix broken documentation URLs in published READMEs. The `@comvi/cli` README pointed at `/docs/i18n/tooling/cli/` (404) — corrected to `/docs/cli/`. The `@comvi/vite-plugin` README's documentation links pointed at `/docs/i18n/tooling/vite-plugin/`, which doesn't exist at any URL — links removed until docs ship.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 8c559e9: Republish all packages from CI via npm Trusted Publishing so every tarball ships with a signed provenance attestation linking it back to the comvi-io/comvi-js release.yml workflow run that built it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 947baf9: Initial public release of Comvi i18n.
